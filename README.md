<code>TO-DO</code>
- More towers, right now 4 more 
  - AOE++
  - POISON++
- Custom game menu - Created but hidden right now
- Biomes map for custom game 
  - We want you to create a map with each "biome" (normal, hell, spooky, snow) with all paths, so that means 4x3 maps, lot of work
- MSG when introducing a cheatcode, done but needs a fix
- Better game balance
- Bug background when resize
- Not responsive, but solve some problems that happen when resizing
- Accordion+gallery slider on instruction menu UI, needs to be responsive

# Easter eggs

<details>
  <summary><code>Why this cheatcode?</code></summary>
  I wanted to do some fun cheat codes (more are coming), and I remembered the Google easter egg they did with Thanos. So I found the gauntlet they used and tried my "own" animation.

<code>Better do not lose.</code>

  <summary><code>Why this easteregg?</code></summary>
  I was trying to do something for the ending screen on losing the game. But I didn't like the audio or the animations.. So I browse reddit, and... voil√°.
